# Practice: Create Stable Automated Tests

## General Rules:

* Don't use Selenium in JUnit tests, only in keywords or POM.
* Don't use assertation in keywords, assert in the test methods.
* Solve every exercises with POM and Keyword Driven methods too

Lets get back to the roots! Recreate your former tests as a new project, with Keyword-Driven Testing, Data-Driven Testing and POM (implement at least the Extensions tasks for each excercise).

### First exercise - Navigation:

* Open the base url. Using the "Menu List" navigate to All Examples/Input Forms/Simpe Form Demo
* Base url: https://web.archive.org/web/20180926132852/http://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/
* Extension: Create reusable navigation keyword (and reuse it :])

### Second exercise - Single field & Button:

* Navigate to Simpe Form Demo. In "Single Input Field" enter a message into the field and click "Show Message" button. Validate that the message appeared.
* Extension: fill the field data-driven way, use a source file for it

### Third exercise - Two fields & Output:

* Navigate to Simpe Form Demo. In "Two Input Fields" enter value A and B and click the "Get Total" button. Validate that the answer is correct.
* Does your test works even when you enter very large numbers?
* Extension: use at least 5 rows from data source with expected results, make positive and negative tests (1, a, expected 1a - failing test)

### Fourth exercise - Checkbox:

* Navigate to Checkbox Demo. In "Single Checkbox Demo" check the checkbox and validate the message.
* Bonus if you write a test for "Multiple Checkbox Demo" and find the bug which is present on the webpage.
* Extension: create a data source with at least 5 rows, with input combinations for checkbox (something like 1,0,1,0 should tick the 2nd and 4th checkboxes), dont forget validations

### Fifth exercise - Select List:

* Navigate to Select Dropdown List. In "Select List Demo" select the current day from the dropdown and validate that it's selected.
* Try out all the way you can select a day.
* Extension: select each days after each other twice (14 in total), use keywords and data source obviously

### Sixth exercise - Radio Buttons:

* Navigate to Radio buttons Demo. In "Group Radio Buttons Demo" select a combination and click the "Get values" button. Validate the result.
* Try to run several combinations in one test.
* Extension: create and validate all possible combinations once, use data source and keywords

## Advanced (Optional)

### Date Picker - Bootstrap:
* Navigate to the Bootstrap Date picker in Date Pickers demo
* Open the "Select Date" picker and validate if 2019 January 14 was a Monday
* Make your test configurable:Make it possible to select any previous date and validate which day of the week was it e.g.: 2017 Dec 8 and 2015, Jan May 5
* Extension: Create a huge data excel manually (~100 rows), with dates, and add days to the next columns randomly (example: 2019 January 14, Monday). Verify how many rows have correct days next to them (should be around 14% pass rate with pure random)
* Tip for creating test data: use bottom right of a cell in excel, and drag down for 100 rows for column A, and use random for column B)
